Hello everyone,

Plant health project is mainly used for farmers to check their crop is healthy or not. if not healthy then cnn model classify which disease it have.

Currently i have only gave three main disease that any plant have namely bacterial spot, easrly blight and late blight.
Dataset taken from plantvillage challenge from kaggle.

This project mainly have two components
1) Working UI website in django framework
2) Working API in flask framework

Two main things you have to do is: run requirements.py file and make cnn model and save it then give it a name "E_demo.h5" and save that file in both django and flask folder.

Enjoy.
